# Natural Language Processing in Tensorflow

The course introduces use of TensorFlow in Natural Language Processing(NLP) by building classifiers based on language models.
In the first week sentiment analysis in text is shown. Where the concepts of encoding words, Toekenizers, Padding are introduced. Also Tensorflow APIs such as Tokenizer and using padding with <OOV> is shown. In the next week the concepts of Text vectorization and word embeddings are introduced. Then they build a classifier to detect sarcasm. In week 3 LSTMs and different sequence models are introduced and explored. In the end, Text generation is explored LSTMs and RNNs.
